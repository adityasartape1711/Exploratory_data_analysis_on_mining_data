# Mining Process Flotation Plant Analysis

## Overview
The Mining Process Flotation Plant Analysis project aims to explore and analyze data from a flotation plant to gain insights into the production of iron concentrate. By utilizing various data analysis techniques, the project seeks to identify trends and correlations that can help optimize operations and improve overall efficiency.

## Project Description
This project utilizes a dataset that includes various parameters affecting the flotation process, such as iron feed composition, silica content, and airflow rates in flotation columns. The goal is to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data that can inform operational strategies for enhancing production efficiency.
